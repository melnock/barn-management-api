## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository.  

Run `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.

There is a seed file with some dummy data.  If you'd like to implement that, run `rails db:seed` to explore functionality.

Once the database is set up, start your rails server and run `npm start` on your frontend.
